<h2>Foundation for Apps</h2>
<p>We use <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/apps.html">Foundation for Apps</a> as a baseline CSS/JS UI system.  It provides a flexbox-based grid, and handy ways to create separate sections of pages, prebuilt with great motion effects.  It also has all the things you'd expect from something like Foundation (or Bootstrap), like buttons, sliders, etc.  And it's all built with Angular, so it's in line with our core tools, and can be modified if needed.</p>
